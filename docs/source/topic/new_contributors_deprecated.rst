Advice for new contributors
===========================

New contributor and not sure what to do? Want to help but just don’t know how to get started? This is the section for you.

First steps
-----------
Start with these easy tasks to contribute to redislite.

Set up Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All redislite development uses the python `tox` tool.

Install it with the python pip packaging tool, like this::

    pip install tox

Writing documentation for redislite just requires a working python with the tox python package installed.

Running and testing code requires a working python development environment and c compiler sufficient to compile redis.

Redislite Development Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Redislite development occurs on github at:
https://github.com/yahoo/redislite

All development should occur on a fork_ or branch of the redislite github repo.

Triage issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is an uncommented issue that reports a bug, try and reproduce it. If you can reproduce it and it seems valid, add a comment that you confirmed the bug. Consider writing a code to test for the bug’s behavior, even if you don’t fix the bug itself.

Reviewing Pull Requests (code reviews)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look at pull requests to build familiarity with the codebase and the process.  Provide comments and feedback if you see issues or can provide more information.

Some things to look for:
* See if the code is missing docs or tests.
* Look through the changes a pull request makes, and keep an eye out for syntax that is incompatible with older but still supported versions of Python.
* Make sure all the tests run and pass under all versions of python.
* Leave comments and feedback!
* Often times the codebase will change between a patch being submitted and the time it gets reviewed. Make sure it an older pull request still aapplies cleanly to the Master branch and functions as expected.

Write some documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The redislite documentation is good but it can always be improved. Did you find a typo? Do you think that something
should be clarified? Go ahead and update the documentation in the docs/source directory.

Once your documentation changes have been made, run the following to generate the html documentation.::

    tox -e build_docs

Then open the ``build/sphinx/html/index.html`` file in your web browser to ensure the generated documentation looks
correct.

One the documentation looks correct, go ahead and submit a pull request.

Testing
-------
Any changes to source code should be tested, both for regression and for validation of new code.

Running all tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All tests can be run using the tox tool without any arguments::

    tox


Style Check
~~~~~~~~~~~
Code submitted to :mod:`redislite` should be compliant with the python pep8_ style guide.

Prior to submitting code, check for pep8_ conformance by running::

    tox -e pep8

Then fix any issues.

Check Code for Common Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before submitting a pull request it's a good idea to run a code analysis tool to identify any common errors and indicators of bad code.  Using python tools such as pylint_ or flake8.

This can be done by running::

    tox -e pylint


Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~
Working unit tests are required for all code that adds new functionality.  Running the unit tests will generate a coverage report at the end of the test output.  The report should show 100% coverage on all code.  The report looks like::

    Name                      Stmts   Miss Branch BrMiss  Cover   Missing
